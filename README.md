# Programming Sheros

When I started following the Fullstack developer course I was not aware of the great women who have been such a big influence in the world of programming.  Our tutor often spoke about these great women and the work that they have done in software development and I was inspired to create this site in the hope that I would discover more about these inspirational women.  The name of the site "Programming Sheros" is a play on words to show the heroic accomplishment of these insirational women.

## Live Link 
The live website can be reached via GitHub Pages on the following link: [Programming Sheros](https://ringhio79.github.io/ProgrammingSheros/index.html)

## UX & Features

The navigation bar at the top of the page allows users to browse through the site with ease.  Each feature page can be accessed through the nabvar links as well as by clicking on the person's name which appears when hovering over one of the images.

Each info page also contains a video feature which is displayed in a modal.  Javascript is used to make sure that the video stops playing when the modal is closed.
